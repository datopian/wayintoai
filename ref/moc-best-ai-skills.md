# MOC: Best AI Skills

Map of Content for the agent skills and conventions worth adopting — the ones Rufus actually keeps in `~/.claude/skills` or wires into `AGENTS.md`. One per job: design, writing voice, slides, changelog process.

Star counts are snapshots (`star_count` / `star_timestamp` in each ref's frontmatter), not live.

## The skills

### Design — [[impeccable]]

Paul Bakaus's design language and agent skill that strips the "slop" from AI-generated interfaces (generic beige, purple gradients, ghost cards, side-tab borders). Hooks run each UI edit through 59 deterministic slop detectors in real time and feed findings back to the agent; the same detector can gate a PR in CI. Per-harness builds add rules for a model's known tells. Reads a project's `DESIGN.md` so the agent knows what a color is *for*.

### Writing — [[humanizer]] + [[soundlikeme]]

Two jobs, two skills:

- **[[humanizer]]** (Siqi Chen / @blader) removes AI tells. Grounded in Wikipedia's community-maintained ["Signs of AI writing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) — 35 patterns across content, grammar, style, chatbot residue, and hedging. Drafts, critiques against the patterns and the original claims, rewrites. Refuses to invent the details a de-slopped rewrite tends to smuggle in.
- **[[soundlikeme]]** (Rufus Pollock) does the harder, less-solved half: sounding like a *specific* person, built from a handful of your own samples and checked with a blind-judged eval harness. Treats tell-removal as table stakes.

Removing every tell can still leave prose that sounds like nobody — and over-editing has its own detectable style. Use humanizer as the floor; use soundlikeme when the output needs to be recognisably *you*.

### Slides — [[frontend-slides]]

Zara Zhang's skill for beautiful web presentations without knowing CSS. "Show, don't tell": it generates visual style previews and you pick, instead of describing aesthetics in words. 12 curated presets, custom animations and hover states, auto-fits any screen. Converts existing PPTX files and preserves their images and brand assets. Output is a single HTML file with inline CSS/JS — "a single HTML file will work in 10 years".

### Changelog process — [[changelog-convention]]

Rufus Pollock's `life-itself/changelog` — a convention, not a tool, for the gap where a good changelog skill still doesn't exist. One markdown block pasted verbatim into a repo's `AGENTS.md`; a longer `CONVENTION.md` fetched only when an entry is actually being drafted. Agents draft an entry at session-checkpoint time, matched to a three-tier weight (skip / one plain sentence / full feature writeup) so the log stays readable. Entries are one file per `changelog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` with `date` / `title` / `promote` frontmatter; committing to the project's own repo is the automatic floor, anything beyond that is a manual promote. Deliberately a pasted convention rather than an auto-loaded skill, so it costs no context per session.

## On the radar

- **[[brag|BRAG]]** — turns a project into a 15–25 second launch video, poster frame, and share copy through one agent command. Looks interesting, but Rufus has not tried it yet, so it is a bookmark rather than part of the adopted shortlist.

## Selection criteria

- **One skill per job.** Design, writing voice, slides — the shortlist, not a directory.
- **Externally anchored where possible.** Humanizer works from a public Wikipedia page; soundlikeme ships an eval harness. Taste that can be audited beats taste you have to trust.
- **Zero / low dependencies.** Markdown skills and single-file HTML output age well.
- **Actually installed.** These are in use, not bookmarked.
